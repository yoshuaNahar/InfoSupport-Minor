:producer_project: producer

==== IDE setup

- Open in your IDE the `{producer_project}` project (either via Maven or Gradle)
- We're assuming that we've taken over the PR. Example of how to achieve that in "real life" for a PR
that got submitted to via a branch called `the_pr` looks like this:

[source,bash]
----
git fetch origin
git checkout -b the_pr origin/the_pr
git merge master
----

- The idea of Spring Cloud Contract is about stub and contract validity. Right now we have a set of
 contracts defined but we haven't tested it against the producer side. Time to change that!
