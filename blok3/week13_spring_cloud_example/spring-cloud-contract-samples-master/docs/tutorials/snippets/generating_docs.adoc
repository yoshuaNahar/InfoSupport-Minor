=== Generating documentation from contracts

Another feature of Spring Cloud Contract is an option to easily create the documentation
of the whole API of the producer. You can create the following test that will generate a
`contracts.adoc` file under `target/generated-snippets/` with description of contracts and
with the contract bodies as such.

TIP: This test is a poor man's version of the documentation generation. You can customize
it as you wish - the current version is just to show you an example.
