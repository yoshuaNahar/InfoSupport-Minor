==== Cloning the producer's code

- In this tutorial we will not clone the producer's code, we'll just open it in the IDE
- There's some production code written on the producer side but you could completely remove it. The idea
of CDC is that defining of contract can be done without writing a single line of code for the feature.

==== Adding dependencies in the producer's clone

- Since we want the IDE to help us with code completion, let's add the necessary Spring Cloud Contract
dependencies. You need to add `spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier` as a test dependency
+
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier</artifactId>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
+
[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
testCompile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier")
----
- This is a task that you would do once only since when you'll be adding next contracts
all the dependencies will already be added
