- We've gone through the HTTP scenario and now it's time for the messaging part.
- Let' start with a test as usual. Let's check out the `BeerVerificationListenerTest` test class
  * there are 2 test methods with empty bodies
  * in both cases we need to trigger a message that will get sent to a destination at which our
  listener class is awaiting messages
  * we're missing the triggering part - but we'll add it in a second
- On the consumer side let's check out the `BeerVerificationListener` class.
  * We're using the Spring Cloud Stream's abstraction of a queue / topic which is called a `channel`.
  * There are 2 channels that come out od the box with SC-Stream. These are `input` and `output`.
  Those channels can be found in 2 interfaces - `Sink` and `Source`. `Sink` contains the `input` channel
  which is used for listening for messages and `Source` contains the `output` channel which
  is used to send messages. In the listener class you can see that we use the `Sink` one cause we're waiting for
  a message to be received.
  * We have to configure the `destination`, so the actual name of a queue / topic on which we will be
  listening. To do that you have to set in the `src/main/resources/application.yml` the property
  `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination: verifications`. That means that the we'll use the
  `input` channel (so the channel in the `Sink` interface) to listen to messages coming from a
  destination called `verifications`.
  * Now that we have configured Spring Cloud Stream let's write the missing feature. If the `eligible` flag
  in the incoming message is `true` - increase the `eligibleCounter` value. Otherwise increment the
  other `notEligibleCounter` one. (<<_missing_listener_code,Show solution>>)
- Now that the implementation is written - let's try to run our `BeerVerificationListenerTest` tests.
Unfortunately they will fail cause no message has been received - we'll still missing that part
