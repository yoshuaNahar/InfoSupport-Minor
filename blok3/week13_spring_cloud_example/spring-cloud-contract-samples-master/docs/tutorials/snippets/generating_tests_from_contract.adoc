==== Generating tests from contracts

- Let's generate the tests! Just call:
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
$ ./mvnw clean install
----
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
$ ./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal
----
  * Suddenly some tests should start failing. Those tests are the autogenerated tests created
  by Spring Cloud Contract
  * The tests lay under `/generated-test-sources/contracts/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/tests/beer`
    in `target` for Maven or `build` for Gradle
  * There will be a test for each folder in which you store your contracts. The name of the test class
    will be the name of that folder
  * Each of the contracts will be a single test inside that test class
  * If you check out the generated tests you'll notice that the dynamic parts of the `request` part
    of the contract got converted to a concrete value. Any dynamic bits on the `response` side would be
    converted into matchers.
- Time to fix the broken tests. We need to do that by providing the missing implementation.
